You can add | grep -c \u0026lt;deployment-name\u0026gt; to count how many pods you have at a current time. You can also filter by label: kubectl get pods -l 'labelname=labelvalue'\nkubectl get deploy -o wide - tells you which version it is getting from the repo, so you can be sure that you are deploying to the correct one. You can also check how many replicas are updated.\nkubectl get configmap \u0026lt;config-map-name\u0026gt; (or kubectl get cm for lazy people like me) - check the config maps that exist. BUT they all already exist basically, so what you usually want to check is what‚Äôs inside them with: kubectl describe cm \u0026lt;config-map-name\u0026gt;.\nNote that if you update the configmap, the values read by the pod don‚Äôt change automatically. The cm are read at the beginning of the deploy so in order to have it read you need to restart the pods.\nkubectl get quota - if you see your pods are not starting and your deployment is stuck, it might be because you ran out of quota. You can also check errors in the events\nGetting logs and events If you need to check events:\nkubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'\nAnd now logs:\nkubectl get logs -f \u0026lt;pod_name\u0026gt;\nOr for pods that have been restarted:\nkubectl get logs \u0026lt;pod_name\u0026gt; ‚Äîprevious\nCreating Secrets Secrets are objects that generally contain sensitive information, such as tokens or secrets. They behave similarly to a configmap but they are used only for sensitive information, so it‚Äôs not hardcoded in the application code.\nEach secret can have several keys, and therefore, several passwords or other pieces of information. You can therefore have a secret called credentials where inside you have two keys password and user with each respective value. Don‚Äôt forget that when reading a secret in your pod.yaml configs you need to specify both the secret name and the key from which you need the value:\n- name: ENV_VAR_NAME\rvalueFrom:\rsecretKeyRef:\rname: secret_name\rkey: password # or whatever your key is\rReading secrets kubectl edit secret \u0026lt;secret‚Äîname\u0026gt; and you can see the secret value there (but don‚Äôt edit it!)\nbut it will show you the secret info and the value encoded in base64. To read it back you must do:\nkubectl get secret \u0026lt;SECRET_NAME\u0026gt; \u0026quot;--template={{.data.password}}\u0026quot; | base64 --decode\nNote that if you do want to edit it like that, you need to convert it to base64 before that.\nAccessing other services From inside the cluster:\ncurl \u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;namespace-name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;\nIf the service you are trying to access is in the namespace as your pod currently is, then you can omit the namespace name and just do\n\u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt;\nOr just use the internal ingress associated with the service. Get it with:\nkubectl get ingress\nGoing inside the pod kubectl exec -it \u0026lt;pod-name\u0026gt; bash ‚Üí if you have only one container in your pod, it will go inside that container. Otherwise, you will have to specify which container in that pod you are trying to access by using -c \u0026lt;container-name\u0026gt;.\nprintenv - run this command while inside the container to print all the environment variables that this is reading. It is particularly useful to verify if the config map and secrets are being correctly read in the pod.\nping \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; or curl \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; - some services are not accessible through your local machine, but only inside the cluster. You can run this inside a pod.\nRequesting without an ingress kubectl port-forward \u0026lt;pod-name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;local-port:pod-port\u0026gt; - useful to do testing curls from your local machine\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":9,"permalink":"/docs/kubernetes/basic-commands/","summary":"Baseline commands kubectl get pods - check if the pods are starting correctly.

However, we do not currently have enough women in tech to have a 50/50 distribution of men and women in these roles. Because of that, we strive to have more girls interested in the area and we want to make sure that the women (and the other tech minorities) that are already in here feel included and have their voices heard. Being empathetic, respectful and inclusive to your coworkers is much more important than hitting quotas. This last part will come eventually, if the overall environment is pleasant and accepting.\nYou can read the summary of the discussion and listen to the whole thing here (in Portuguese).\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":10,"permalink":"/about-me/events/public-speaking-events/","summary":"Diversity and Inclusion in the tech world 27/06/2024 I was a guest in an event for Career Management in Tech where I spoke about the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as a representative of As Raparigas do C√≥digo.","tags":[],"title":"Public Speaking Events"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":11,"permalink":"/about-me/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":12,"permalink":"/docs/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":13,"permalink":"/privacy/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Policy"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":14,"permalink":"/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Teresa Alves"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":15,"permalink":"/categories/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":16,"permalink":"/contributors/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contributors"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":17,"permalink":"/tags/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tags"}]
