Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am Teresa Alves, a Software Engineer from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹
I have a background in Control and Automation (aka Math and Robots) and I have professional experience as a backend, platform and systems engineer.

I am also a volunteer for [As Raparigas do CÃ³digo](https://raparigasdocodigo.pt/), a volunteer organization focused including women in the tech world, and to get young childrens interested in technology.

This website will share my quick guides to certain technologies, that will help me not forget things, and might help you learn them.

Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresalves/)!

## Need help with life?

If you need help with things, I can help with the following technical things:
- basics of programming;
- what is backend, frontend, devops?;
- setting up your first API
- mock technical interviews;
- System design;
- Observability;
- Other platform related things (feel free to ask);


Non technical stuff:
- Starting a career in tech;
- building a CV;
- how to show confidence in interviews;
- how to deal with anxious dogs;

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn with any questions

## Can I contribute?

These notes represent things I know or have studied so I don't really want external contributions for whole new modules. However, feel free to add new issues in this repo for doc requests or propose fixes for somethign I already have that seems incorrect or incomplete!
