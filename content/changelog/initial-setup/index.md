Just a first commit - my dog, some thoughts and some docs have been added, starting with Kubernetes.

`feat!:` will represent full new sections\
`feat:` will mean there were new submodules\
`fix:` just a fix to existing things

Typos and other irrelevant things will not be worthy of an entry here
Long/mid term, these changelogs should be automated.
